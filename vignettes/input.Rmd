## Input data

The main input to oncoEnrichR is a list of human genes, typically the top ranked hits from a high-throughput screen. The gene list can be provided by using any of the following identifiers:

 - Primary gene symbols (e.g. **`KRAS`**)
 - Entrez gene IDs (e.g. **`3845`**)
 - Uniprot accessions (e.g. **`P01116`**)
 - Ensembl gene identifiers (e.g. **`ENSG00000133703`**)
 - Ensembl transcript identifiers (e.g. **`ENST00000311936`**)
 - Ensembl protein identifiers (e.g. **`ENSP00000308495`**)
 - RefSeq transcript identifiers (e.g. **`NM_004985`**)
 - RefSeq peptide identifiers (e.g. **`NP_004976`**)
 
The type of identifier used should be specified using the `--query_id_type` argument. Similarly,
if a background gene set is specified (through the `--bgset` argument, for use in enrichment analysis), the identifier type should be set with the `--bgset_id_type` argument.

If the user submits gene symbols which are no longer considered as primary gene symbols, oncoEnrichR
attempts to map such cases as synonyms/aliases for the primary gene symbols.

### Number of input genes

In order to keep the size of the HTML output report at a manageable level, there is currently an upper limit of

  * **`n = 500`** 

genes that can be used as input to the tool. Please also note that the tool requires `n = 2` input genes at the bare minimum, although some analysis modules will not be included/run with so few genes as input.
