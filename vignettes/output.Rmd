## Output files

The output of the analyses performed with oncoEnrichR are provided in two different formats:

* An interactive HTML report
* A multi-sheet Excel workbook


### HTML report

Here, we showcase screenshots from the oncoEnrichR interactive HTML report, following the
various types of questions that can be answered with the tool.

#### Query verification

* Are all my gene/query identifiers correctly identified? Are some of my query identifiers outdated, and no longer considered the primary identifier?
